The work of computer scientists is essential because computers and technology have become an integral part of our daily lives. They help to solve complex problems in various fields, including healthcare, education, transportation, and business, by developing software applications, designing algorithms, and building computer systems.
•	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem, I take into consideration the requirements and use that as an outline to complete my project. From there, I break down the problem into manageable sections or goals. Then, I do my research on the matter to ensure that I am knowledgeable on the matter I am solving. I then write the code that solves the problem. After that, I do rigorous bug-checking and stress tests. 
•	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My duty is to ensure that people’s privacy remains secure and is not easily accessible to the public. I must keep their privacy in mind when creating applications.
